# General Tech/Information

### Enemy Types & Details

#### Visorak

The Visorak are the most basic and weak enemy type. They have a few different attack types, 2 projectile, 1 melee.

Visorak can shoot their Rhotuka spinner at the player, as well as a short range generic bullet attack. They can also jump at the player, which is the most effective attack damage wise, but is easy to dodge.

#### Bohrok

The Bohrok are the well rounded basic enemy type. They can do a wider variety of things in comparison to their counterparts.

In their most basic configuration, they will be on foot, attacking with single charge shots of their blasters, weaker rapid fire, and their rollout maneuver. This rollout maneuver is also given a shield the higher the completion percentage is set in a save file. Bohrok can also fly, and while doing so will shoot at the player, but cannot access rollout as well as their shield.

#### Vahki

The Vahki are the point guard type of enemy. They are usually found blocking access to a passageway or canisters and caches of pieces.

The ones in the earlier sections of the game are stronger than both other standard enemy types, but still go down fairly easy. The Vahki while in sentry mode will shoot Kanoka disks at the player from a distance, and slam their melee weapons to the ground for an AoE blast when the player gets close. Later in the game, they have a chance of getting back up when defeated, and if they do they switch from their sentry mode into a mad pursuit of the player. They stand on their two feet instead of on all fours, and shoot beams out of their weapons. The trade off to this state is that they spawn with roughly two-thirds health, and have less damage resistance.

#### Rahkshi

The Rahkshi is the first boss type in the game. They are used in the first level of each zone/world. The fight consists of one to two uses of a golden constraction, and then a phase where the Rahkshi will attack the player a set amount of times and then let out a battle cry, which lowers their shields for the player to damage them. \
 \
 In the early game, the Rahkshi will place their staff over their shoulder and fire a single projectile at the player when attacking from a distance. Up close, they will do a spin attack that spawns a projectile at the end of the move. Towards mid-game, they then start doing a beam attack long range, and a staff slam close range. The long range attacks are longer, but require three uses for them to drop their shield, and the close range attacks are shorter, but require four uses to drop their shield.

#### Dark Hunters

The Dark Hunters are the last hurdle in the way of the player reaching the Piraka of each zone/world. As a result, they are titans in comparison to the other enemy types. They appear in this order during Any%: Roodaka, Nidhiki, Axxon, Krekka, Brutaka, Sidorak. \

##### Roodaka

Roodaka, the queen of the Visorak. This foe’s fight entails the defeat of hoards of Visorak to get Hero Mode and activate three golden constractions. This phase destroys her arm, and stops the hordes of Visorak. From here, you are engaged in a one-on-one battle with her. She will shoot an energy projectile at you and strafe left or right to counter your movement. After two shots, she will drop her shield for the player to damage her. After the player has damaged her enough, she loses her other arm, and is now helpless. When finished off by the player, the mask spawns on the leftmost part of the player’s side of the arena.

### Techniques

- Strafe Running
  - Optimal movement in Bionicle Heroes is achieved by holding forward and a strafe direction while having the camera rotated so that it sends you forward. This speed exploit is the basic foundation for many tricks in the game, as it is just enough of a speed boost to take advantage of various instances of faulty collision clipping throughout the game. The console ports can also benefit from this, but the angle is usually NNE and NNW.
- Kongu WrongJump
  - Using Kongu’s jumping ability, it is possible in some instances to desync the jump and use an object (walls, trees, interactive builds) to make Kongu do a “WrongJump.” This can be used in a variety of ways to jump out of bounds and skip portions of the level.
- Footloose Skip
  - A method of skipping room-entry cutscenes. In some instances, holding forward while walking through a portion of a CS trigger can cancel the cutscene.
- Nuparu Wall Fall
  - A trick where Nuparu does not attach properly to a climbing wall. Skips a slow climb down, or may grant the ability to go out of bounds.
- Hero Mode Preservation
  - A trick where Hero Mode is used while triggering a cutscene with a specific timing which allows Hero Mode to be retained. This is currently used in Bleak Refinery and Menacing Keep. There are likely other levels or methods that allow for this, but the trick is still not fully understood.
- Constraction Animation Cancel
  - A trick where you can cancel a constraction animation by pressing the “previous toa” and “interact” buttons on the same frame or collect a mask near a constraction. Useful for sections where you have to build stuff with Hewkii, but it is either situational or a difficult frame 1 trick. However, only sometimes will it let you continue to switch toa after executing the trick, and if you switch back to the toa interacting with a constraction, you’ll be locked in for the remainder of the hold period on it.

- Tips
  - Shoot the rubber band shootable blocking the gate’s gears with Hewkii
    - Doing this either significantly reduces the chances of getting a Fikou Spider spawn, or prevents it altogether.
  - Quicker Tunnel Entry Strat
    - As soon as you enter the water path, start damaging each boulder with Hahli’s weapon until they’re both a little under half health. From there switch to Hewkii, and shoot the top one and it should break both quickly. Then climb the right side of the jaw with Kongu as it descends to get in the tunnel just a bit faster.
  - Trigger Skipped Enemy Spawns
    - In the GC3 grind area, if you want to grind Hero Mode before you do Chest Skip, you can hit the spawn trigger for the enemies on your way back in bounds by strafe running in where the wall for the water area and the grind area meet
  - Defeat Enemies and Collect Pieces During Guurahk Fight
    - If you do chest skip, you will not have enough pieces to upgrade Nuparu after the level unless you grind out pieces in the fight. Minimum exit count is 50k, recommended is around 54-56k

  - After getting to the GC3 grind area, shoot the liftarm, container, and boulder stack to clear some space. From there, strafe run onto the chest from the left side, and reposition to as close to the bottom right corner of the chest. From here, strafe run and turn into the gap between the rocks behind the chest and get up onto the leftmost rock. Stick yourself into the spot where the rock above you locks you in place, and then turn the camera to the left until your character walks past the rock. Continue to strafe run and turn the camera back to the right after falling off the rock and being over the GC.

- Tips
  - GC1 Grind Optimizations
    - When Grinding for GC1, launch a Nuparu grenade to the left of the first boulder pile when entering the pancam, it should defeat a Bohrok and break that pile. The angle for this shot to hit this is really low. Generally, it's going to line up close to the floor and lower right corner of the doorway. After the pancam concludes, clean up the remaining enemies and breakables and either back up to the back right corner and shoot the spawns for magnet pieces, or use the single boulder in the front left corner to clip up into the spawn area. After activating the GC, when you regain control over your camera, shoot the boulder pile that hides the gears for the next door with Hewkii.
  - GC2 Grind Optimizations
    - After starting the spawns, go up to the shortest part of the wall and shoot between the set of pillars to the left with a Nuparu grenade. That should net you quite a few pieces at the start, then turn around and shoot the 2 Visorak and 1 Bohrok that spawn behind you.
  - Hewkii Constraction Animation Cancel
    - After GC2, defeat the enemies on the dock and start the constraction and then run into the Matoro mask and continue holding the interact button. You can change toa in this instance, so you can switch to Nuparu and wipe the enemies behind the boat and crane while it finishes. It's also possible to cancel with the 1 frame constraction cancel version of the tech.
  - Kongu Weapon Upgrade Note
    - After this level in Any%, you’ll upgrade Kongu’s weapon for the first time. If you got 54-56k in Piraka Bluff, you should be relatively close if not completely fine by the time you get to the end of the level. If you still need more, there are plenty of shootables in the immediate vicinity of the Zamor Sphere. If that’s also not enough, the building directly to the right when walking to the GC also has a cache of pieces.

Jump onto the wall, and then turn around to face the return jump pad. Strafe run to the left and time your jump late, and you will wrong jump past the collision preventing you from walking around the lip of the wall that leads to the lift. Stay as far to the left as possible and head for the lift.

  - After the golden constraction finishes, hug the right side of the wall with a strafe run and get on the wall. Continue to use strafe run inputs all the way up, and once you reach the apex of the wall, the game can freak out and not let you stand up, as well as put you on the wall behind the Nuparu wall. This can provide access to the Drench ability room without Hahli, but is as softlock. Mods have also shown that with enough speed (raising Nuparu’s movement speed value up to 15) you can completely clear the jump and get to the other side of the wall really quickly. This would skip building the door, opening it, as well as the next door, and the entire cave section. It is unknown whether an angle that can be done in the vanilla game to skip the indoor section.

    - Skip grabbing Hero Mode before GC1, there are a lot of pieces between that GC and the boss fight. However, clearing the enemies and giving yourself some space to do the GC1 skip cannot hurt.

### Skips

- [Skip Golden Constraction 1](https://youtu.be/EVsIYl0hFes)
  - --gcn:needstesting --ps2:needstesting --x360:needstesting --pc:working --wii:needstesting
  - Difficulty: Intermediate
  - Strafe-walk along the ridge to the right of the boulders and you can end up on the rocks blocking the Nuparu Wall. Stand on the left side of the rocks and you should be able to grab the wall. Your Hero Mode Meter will update when you grab the wall.

  - Difficulty: Master
  - Attach the sides to the lift, and then go to the one with the lever next to it. Line yourself up with the wall and run between the gap between the wall and the side of the lift, and if done correctly, you should clip through the floor and drop straight down to the area the lift takes you to. Doesn’t save time if you don’t get the clip relatively quickly.

  - Right before you enter the Nidhiki fight, there’s a small window where you can activate the golden constraction. If you do so, some of the animation will play during the cutscene, and Nidhiki should take damage shortly after the cutscene ends.

## Thok’s Grotto

### Important Information and Tips

- Important Information
  - Cutscene Lengths
    - Opener: 8 seconds
    - Thok Damage 1: 13 seconds
    - Thok Damage 2: 9 seconds
    - Thok Damage 3: 13 seconds
    - Thok Helpless: 7 seconds
    - Thok Death: 11 seconds
    - Vezon & Fenrakk appear: 13 seconds
    - Victory/Level Complete: 9 seconds
- Tips
  - Faster Enemy Spawns
    - When Thok jumps up onto his pedestals to spawn enemies, face the camera towards the ground. The spawns won’t happen if they are visible to the player, and the game tries really hard to maintain this.
  - GC Activation
    - Wait a second before activating the GC when it gives you the opportunity. When it rises out of the red protodermis pool, the prompt is active earlier than it can actually be activated. Not doing so will give a false activation and make you activate it again.

### Skips

- Thok-icide x
  - --gcn:working --ps2:needstesting --x360:working --pc:working --wii:needstesting
  - Difficulty: Master
  - Under unknown circumstances, it is possible for Thok to desync with his nav mesh and fall into the red protodermis pools. Since there is no proper kill plane in Heroes, Thok will eventually be despawned due to no longer being within a set proximity to the player. This then spawns the Thok mask object that summons Vezon and Fenrakk.

- Tips
  - Beginning Area Vahki Displacement
    - In the beginning area, there’s a Vahki blocking your exit. If you defeat it quickly with Hewkii and immediately start the constraction, the Vahki will be moved out of the way with the movement of the pieces.
  - GC1 Matoro Lever Optimization
    - After activating the GC, when you gain the ability to switch toa again, switch to Matoro and line up with the lever. Just before the GC animation cycle ends, you should be able to zoom in and shoot the lever if positioned and timed correctly.
  - Cart Ride Optimization
    - After you cross over the water with Hahli, approach the cart and build it and immediately with Hewkii.

  - By walking into a certain part of the stage with enough speed, you can get up with Tuurahk before the golden constraction allows. This is a small timesave, simply allowing you to cause Tuurahk to do slam attacks sooner than if you waited until you could cross over the bridge. Once you are on stage though, you’re stuck until the fight is over.

## Vezon’s Awakening

### Important Information and Tips

- Tips
  - Shoot Fenrakk’s Legs and Tail With Matoro
    - Matoro’s weapon is the best pick for this because it's guaranteed to hit them. Kongu is close second, but with the spread and inaccuracy his weapon has, using him is ill-advised. The other Toa also have issues hitting Fenrakk, Nuparu’s and Hewkii’s respective projectiles are slow and unlikely to hit properly because of their damage type, as well as Hahli and Jaller having a hard time connecting with it as well.
  - Shoot Fenrakk’s Head With Kongu
    - Only Kongu can hit Fenrakk’s head reliably, so Kongu is the only option here.
  - Break down Fenrakk’s Legs With Hahli
    - Hahli’s weapon can hit Fenrakk’s legs after he has been defeated, so she is the best option because of her bullet type.
- 1st Phase
  - The first phase of the fight, Fenrakk steps up on the stage with one of two legs, and then slams with both. He can also breath fire, which is bad RNG in the fight
    - First cycle order is right, left, slam
    - Second cycle order is right, left, slam
    - Third cycle order is right, left, left, slam
    - Fourth cycle order is right, left, slam
    - Fifth cycle order is right, left, right, left, left, slam
- 2nd Phase
  - The second phase of the fight, Fenrakk now presents his front legs as targets now that he no longer has a tail. When the player takes out the legs, they finish off Fenrakk. Fire breathing is bad RNG.
    - Step order is right, left, slam, right, left, slam, right (loses leg), left, (loses leg), head becomes vulnerable.
